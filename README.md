# AES-128
This is a implementation of AES 128 in c language using minimum no of libraries.
Source file contains the source code of each function including AES-encryption and decryption.
There are five mode of opeartions which do the encryption and decryption after doing the padding PKCS#7. Unpadding is not done, but it is trivial to do.
The documentation file contains all details about the implementation.
AES 128 intel intrinsic is also done as a part of complete work.
